# Student Result Scraper

A Python script to scrape student result data from a college result portal using Selenium.

## Features
- Automatically selects institute, degree, semester, and exam schedule.
- Iterates through a range of student IDs to extract results.
- Saves the extracted data into an Excel file.

## Limitations
This script is specifically hardcoded to:
- **Institute**: CSPIT
- **Degree**: BTECH(AIML)
- **Semester**: 3rd
- **Exam Schedule**: NOVEMBER 2024
- **Student Count**: 76 students (IDs from `23AIML001` to `23AIML076`).

If you wish to scrape results for other institutes, degrees, semesters, or exam schedules, you will need to modify the dropdown selection logic in the script.

## Requirements
- Python 3.7 or higher
- Google Chrome Browser
- ChromeDriver (compatible with your Chrome version)

## Example File
- The repository includes an `example.xlsx` file with sample student result data.
- This serves as a reference for the format of the output generated by the script.
